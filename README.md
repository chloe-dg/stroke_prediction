Applying Classification algorithms to identify stroke patients, Recall 84%

Using Kaggle dataset from link: https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset?select=healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv

I apply classification algorithms: Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression to identify stroke patients. Apply SMOTE technique to balance out the imbalance dataset.
Use GridSearch to tune the models for better performance.
